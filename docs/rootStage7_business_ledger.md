Purpose of Stage 7

Stage 7 transforms HashHelix from a prototype into a sealed deterministic engine with a complete and verifiable artifact pipeline.
This stage defines the permanent public engine layer that will remain open, auditable, and immutable — while the private economy layer remains sealed.

Core Outcomes of Stage 7
1. Lock the Singularity Artifact Schema (HOT Vault)

Defines:

recurrence

lane parameters

vault class

chiral flag

integrity root

engine metadata

The Singularity is the root computational engine.

2. Define Cold Temporal Relics (COLD Vault)

Relics are:

tokenized

frozen

distributable

chiral-preserved

externally anchorable

validated by the HOT engine

3. Business Layer Separation

Public engine (open):

recurrence rules

chiral commitments

epoch combiner

Merkle sealing

schemas

integrity paths

Private layer (sealed):

tokenomics 1.4

business logic

relic issuance rules

institutional runtime protocols

4. Epoch → Relic Pipeline

Lanes →

Epochs →

Merkle →

Relic →

Chiral seal →

COLD vault class

This defines deterministic verification.

5. Anti-Fork & Audit Rules

no nested schema folders

deterministic lineage

immutable HOT engine

verifiable ancestry

artifact sealing rules

Closing Statement

Stage 7 finalizes the HashHelix public engine.
The deterministic recurrence and artifact pipeline are now permanently defined and cannot be changed outside formal Stage Gates.

The economy remains sealed and private — by design.
