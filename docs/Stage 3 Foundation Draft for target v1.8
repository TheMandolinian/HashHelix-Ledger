1. Core Recurrence 
HashHelix is defined by a deterministic, time-indexed recurrence: 
�
�1 = 1,𝑎𝑛 = ⌊𝑛⋅sin⁡(𝑎𝑛−1 +𝜋
 𝑛
 Properties: 
)⌋ +1 
• Sequential per lane — Each state depends on its immediate predecessor. 
• Parallel across lanes — Multiple independent recursions may be evaluated 
concurrently. 
• High throughput on commodity hardware: 
o ≈ 8.24 million steps/sec (synthetic peak, 3-lane configuration) 
o ≈ 8.1 million steps/sec (7–15 lanes sustained) 
o ≈ 3.4 million steps/sec (multi-core “blast” benchmark under load) 
HashHelix therefore functions as a CPU-bound deterministic temporal primitive, distinct 
from blockchain or DAG-based consensus systems. 
2. Sequentiality and Verification 
2.1 Sequentiality 
For any lane, the recurrence is inherently sequential: 
• Computing 𝑎𝑛requires knowledge of 𝑎𝑛−1. 
• There is no known shortcut or algebraic method to bypass intermediate states. 
• This behavior is analogous to Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) and Proof-of
History (PoH) constructions. 
2.2 Evaluation and Verification Costs 
Current evaluation and verification model: 
• Evaluation cost: 𝑂(𝑛) 
• Verification cost: 𝑂(𝑛)by deterministic recomputation 
This is suitable for Proof-of-Time (PoT) contexts where hardware time and compute cost 
are part of the trust model. 
Planned extension: introduction of sparse checkpoint commitments, e.g., every 
216steps, aggregated into a Merkle tree. 
This enables: 
• Efficient 𝑂(log⁡𝑛)partial verification 
• Third-party auditability 
• Compact proof sizes 
3. Chiral Mode (Dual Helix Extension) 
To provide inherent tamper-evidence and redundancy, HashHelix supports a 
complementary backward-phase recurrence. 
Forward helix: 
Reverse helix: 
�
�𝑛 + = ⌊𝑛 ⋅ sin⁡(𝑎𝑛−1
 + +𝜋
 𝑛
 𝑎𝑛 − = ⌊𝑛 ⋅ sin⁡(𝑎𝑛−1
 A chiral commitment is computed from the pair: 
)⌋ +1 
− −𝜋
 𝑛
 )⌋ +1 
�
�𝑛 =SHA256 ⁣(min⁡(𝑎𝑛 +,𝑎𝑛 −) ∥ max⁡(𝑎𝑛 +,𝑎𝑛 −)) 
Chiral mode provides: 
• Intrinsic tamper detection: divergence between helices is immediately observable 
• Redundant state evolution: two independent paths validate lane integrity 
• Not intended as a full proof-of-computation, but as a lightweight integrity layer 
4. Security Considerations 
4.1 Initial Assumptions 
• No known shortcut exists to compute 𝑎𝑛without evaluating all intermediate steps. 
• Per-lane sequentiality is strong; lanes remain fully independent. 
• The recurrence is purely arithmetic; security questions center on: 
o orbit stability 
o entropy characteristics 
o periodicity or attractor formation 
o behavior under fixed-precision evaluation 
4.2 Open Security Questions and Ongoing Work 
• Entropy analysis: 
o study of 1–2 million-step sequences 
o NIST SP 800-22 tests 
o Lyapunov exponent estimation 
o Autocorrelation and FFT-based period detection 
• Cycle detection: 
o Floyd/Brent cycle-finding 
o detection of orbit collapse 
• Replacement of floating-point trig: 
o CORDIC or integer approximations 
o fixed-precision deterministic evaluation 
• Merkle checkpoint verification: 
o enabling sublinear audit paths for long sequences 
5. Intended Applications 
HashHelix is a temporal primitive, not a consensus protocol or ledger. 
Its primary function is to provide a high-resolution, deterministic timebase suitable for 
anchoring external data or processes. 
Applications include: 
• Proof-of-Time (PoT) / Fair Ordering 
Provides a deterministic and replayable clock for ordering events, mitigating MEV and 
timestamp manipulation. 
• Deterministic AI Training Lineage 
Each training iteration can be bound to a specific step index, ensuring exact reproducibility 
of model evolution. 
• Scientific and Experimental Recordkeeping 
Enables replayable experiment timelines with deterministic state evolution. 
• External Ledger Anchoring (XRPL/XLM) 
HashHelix lanes can be periodically anchored to public ledgers to create independent, 
verifiable temporal checkpoints. 
• Temporal Compression and Integrity 
Combines chiral commitments and checkpoint trees to offer tamper-evident, space
efficient temporal history. 
6. Summary 
• HashHelix introduces a high-speed arithmetic Proof-of-Time primitive capable of 
multi-million-step throughput on consumer hardware. 
• Each lane provides strong sequentiality with natural parallelism across lanes. 
• Chiral mode enhances integrity, while checkpointing offers a path toward sublinear 
verification. 
• Ongoing research focuses on entropy behavior, fixed-point determinism, and 
formal security analysis. 
• The system is positioned as a deterministic timebase suitable for indexing external 
data, enabling fair ordering, reproducibility, and verifiable temporal anchoring.
