# Stage 9 — Anchor Commitment Rules

Institutions must publish the following components when anchoring data:

- Merkle root
- Sequence hash
- Chiral twin signature
- Envelope signature (institution)
- HH engine signature (system-level)
- Optional hash-only XRPL anchor

Anchors must be reproducible and validated by the Stage 9 schema.
