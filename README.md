HashHelix Ledger v1.6 — Deterministic Epoch Baseline

A π/n-phase-drifted sine recursion as a temporal primitive for cryptographic ledgers.

HashHelix introduces the first known use of a π/n recursive sine function as a deterministic temporal engine inside a ledger.
Each step of the recursion produces a time-embedded, mathematically reproducible state transition — replacing traditional consensus with pure computation.

At its core, HashHelix is:

Deterministic — the same inputs always produce the same ledger

Temporal — recursion encodes step-count time directly into state evolution

Verifiable — each lane produces SHA-256 strand commitments (h₊, h₋)

Chiral-aware — dual helices yield a unique chiral commitment

Epoch-sealed — Merkle proofs snapshot the ledger in immutable increments

This v1.6 release defines the Genesis Integrity Line — the earliest stable version from which all computation lanes, research relics, and distributed verification systems can be built.

## Core Concepts (v1.7 terminology)

To avoid confusion between the engine and the artifacts, HashHelix uses the following terms going forward:

- **Singularity**  
  The deterministic core engine of the HashHelix Ledger.  
  It implements the π/n-phase-drifted recurrence and produces a fully reproducible temporal state sequence.

- **Time Shards** (internal)  
  Internal units of temporal progression generated by the Singularity.  
  Time Shards are *not* user-facing assets; they only exist inside the engine as part of the hashing and state evolution process.

- **Temporal Relics** (formerly “shards”)  
  User-facing artifacts created by the Singularity.  
  A Temporal Relic is a signed, versioned object that can represent a dataset, experiment, benchmark run, or narrative artifact.  
  Relics do not contain the engine; they reference it.

- **Relic Lineages**  
  Each Temporal Relic can act as the root of a lineage (a branch of meaning or application logic).  
  Lineages define how Relics relate to each other over time (for example, a Genesis Relic spawning derived Relics).

- **Genesis Temporal Relic 000000**  
  The first Temporal Relic created in the HashHelix ecosystem.  
  It is a legendary artifact and a symbolic origin for Relic lineages, but it does not replace the Singularity or act as a second engine.

🧬 What v1.6 Establishes
✔ Clean, deterministic lane configuration

lanes.json defines the authoritative set of computation lanes.

✔ Epochs 1–2 fully rebuilt and verified

Using the new scripts/epoch_tools.py:

python scripts/epoch_tools.py verify "epochs/epoch-*.json"


Both epochs returned:
[OK] epoch-000001.json
[OK] epoch-000002.json

Strict .gitignore rules

All scratch directories, dev artifacts, and unstable files excluded:

hh_tmp/

__pycache__/

*.pyc

genesis test relics (relics/genesis/[0-9]*/)

.venv/

chat.txt

This keeps the repository mathematically stable and audit-safe.

Canonical folder structure for future expansion

Future Temporal Relic types — computation, research, Singularity-bound, cold-storage, proof-chains — now rest on a clean baseline.

Verification Badge

This badge will automatically validate Merkle roots and chiral commitments as more epochs are added.
